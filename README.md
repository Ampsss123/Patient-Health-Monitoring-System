Developed a heart rate and temperature monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system will utilize a Pulse Sensor to measure the heart rate (in beats per minute) and an LM35 temperature sensor to monitor the surrounding temperature. The data will be displayed on an LCD screen, providing real-time feedback on the user's pulse and ambient temperature. The system should also output the heart rate data to the serial monitor for additional logging and analysis. The key requirements include:

Accurate heart rate detection using the Pulse Sensor.
Real-time display of heart rate (BPM) and temperature on the LCD screen.
Configuration of sensor thresholds for optimal performance.
Integration of serial communication to print heart rate data for further analysis.
